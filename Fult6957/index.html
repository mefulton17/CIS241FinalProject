                <p class="MsoNormal">Hello! My name is
                    Ian Hella and I am finishing my second
                    year at Edmonds Community College. My goal is to attain an ATA degree
                    in web
                    development and I am almost there! Afterward, I plan to start looking for a position in that
                    industry. I currently live in Mountlake Terrace very close to the
                    college.
                    However, I may choose to relocate based on job location. <o:p></o:p></p>
                    <p class="MsoNormal">Some things I enjoy
                    are spending time with my family (I am a
                    proud father of 1), studying web development outside of school,
                    exercise,
                    reading, and fishing. I am on track to graduate at the end of the
                    this spring
                    quarter and I cannot wait. I would hope to attain a job at an established
                    company
                    with a great work culture. I consider myself friendly, and easy to talk
                    to around
                    co-workers as well as close friends.</p>
                    <p class="MsoNormal"> <o:p></o:p>In
                    conclusion, please feel free to contact me regarding any
                    job offerings via email as I would greatly appreciate them. Also, if
                    you have
                    any constructive criticisms, or general tips they would all be very
                    much
                    appreciated and helpful. Thank you for surfing to my site and enjoy!<o:p></o:p></p>
